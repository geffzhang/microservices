## Overview 
This repository contains content that will help you get started with building Microservices using Docker Containers, Kubernetes as technologies and Microsoft Azure as a platform.  

The strucure of the content is bit losse, but here is the list of artifacts availalbe. 

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)*

  + *Part I â€“ Kubernetes DevOps : Introduction to the Historic Events Microservice:*   
  + *Service-Fabric:* All content in this folder is related to Microsoft Service Fabric including labs and supporting documents. 

+ *Reference-Material:* Contains content related to architecture, design and implementation of Microservices but mainly driven by experiences and lesson learned from the field. This also means that content is spread across broad range of topics. For example, design consideration for building Microservices on Azure platform (Containers and Service Fabric) versus how to implement mutual TLS in a Docker Swarm cluster.
